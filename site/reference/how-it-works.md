# How it works

```
run.ps1 ─► cli/            Node CLI: analyzes the game, builds a temporary web build, drives wrangler
           runtime/        Plugins injected into the web build (appended to the build's js/plugins.js)
             RWK_Core            config, device id, toasts, dialogs, ⏸ menu, web build label
             RWK_SaveSync        save sync (MZ: localforage, MV: localStorage)
             RWK_MobileControls  on-screen buttons, driven through Input._currentState
             RWK_Speed           fast forward: the scene updates 2–4 times per frame
             RWK_Message         message modes: tap to finish, Auto, Skip (Window_Message)
             RWK_SaveTools       save export / import / delete (desktop save file format)
             RWK_ItemBatch       use several items at once (MZ / MV adapter for the common event queue)
             RWK_Report          problem report: latest errors, audio state, files that failed to load
           worker/         One Worker shared by every game
             index.js            static files + large files from R2 (with Range) + /api
             auth.js             verifies Cloudflare Access logins (JWT)
             saves.js            save API, with ETag overwrite protection
             players.js          counts the emails that save, for the deploy's reminder
```

## The build

The game folder is never written to. Each run:

1. Picks the files: the standard RPG Maker folders, plus `include`, minus `exclude`.
2. **Hard-links** them into `<game drive>:\.rwk-build\` (no extra disk space; copies on another drive).
3. Adds the plugins to the build's copy of `js/plugins.js` and marks `index.html` with `<meta name="generator" content="rpgmaker-web-toolkit">`. Unless a public site asked to be listed: a `noindex` meta tag, `X-Robots-Tag: noindex` and a `robots.txt`.
4. Uploads files over 25 MiB to R2, skipping unchanged ones by hash. The limits come from [`cli/limits.json`](/reference/limits#when-cloudflare-changes-them), downloaded from `main` on each run.
5. Deploys the Worker with the rest as static files (wrangler also uploads only changes).
6. Deletes the build folder.

## Storage

Static files are **Workers Static Assets** (free, unmetered bandwidth). One R2 bucket, `rpgmaker-web-toolkit`, holds the rest:

```
rwk/games.json                       settings of every game (keyed by fingerprint)
assets/<slug>/<path>                 files over 25 MiB
assets/<slug>/.rwk-manifest.json     hashes of those files
saves/<sha256(email)>/<slug>/<name>  saves (config, global, file1…)
rwk/players/<slug>.json              hashes of the emails that saved, with the first save time
```

Saves are stored under a hash of the email, never the email itself.

## Save sync

At boot, before the engine reads a save, the plugin keeps the newer of each local / cloud pair and asks when both changed. Each save uploads about a second later with `If-Match`, so it never silently overwrites another device. What players see: [Saves on several devices](/play/saves).

## Security

- **Cloudflare Access** blocks requests at Cloudflare's edge; the Worker also checks the login's signature to learn the email.
- Until Access is set up, every request gets the [*being set up*](/setup/first-deploy#lock-protect-play) page.
- Preview URLs are off (they bypass Access).
- The Cloudflare login has only the permissions it needs, in its own wrangler profile.

A game's [`rwk-policy.json`](/creators/policy) is read on every run and can stop the deploy, keep the site private or turn features off.
